# 3D-Objekt-Rendering

This is a university project where I had to render 3 objects using DirectX 11. These objects had to have one shader each. The scenario we were to create was:
Rough/Matte/Glossy scenario: create a scenario where the objects are rendered side by side with different surface properties.
